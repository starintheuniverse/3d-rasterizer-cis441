# 3d-rasterizer-cis441
I wrote this program for UO CIS441, Computer Graphics (w/ Prof. Hank Childs).
It takes as input a vector of triangles (vertex locations, vertex colors, vertex normals) + camera and lighting parameters, and renders an image.
Depends on VTK to read in polygon data files and to write a color buffer to a PNG image.
Depends on C++ standard library for memory copy and floating point math.
Prof. Childs supplied an animation over the camera parameters.
All other code was written by me by hand.
